# rootedtreeapprox
Matlab code to accompany "Exact solutions and bounds for network SIR and SEIR models using a rooted-tree approximation", accessible on [ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07128).

This repository contains MATLAB code for running Gillespie algorithm simulations and solving rooted tree approximation differential equations for both SIR and SEIR models on a range of different networks. 

Files beginning with 'run' are script m-files designed to be easy to edit and run. These are interfaces for the corresponding function m-files without 'run' in the title.

generateAdj.m is an m-file for generating adjacency matrices of a range of different types. See the comments at the start of the file for more details.
